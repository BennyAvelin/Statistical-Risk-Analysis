# GEV notebooks

Just click the badge below and a Binder instance will spin up for you
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/BennyAvelin/Statistical-Risk-Analysis/master/GEV).

When you click this you will be redirected to a website where you have to wait until the notebook instance has started, it will then reload and you will be facing Jupyter. 

During the run of this instance it will be possible to edit and save the file, but please make sure you download the notebook regularly since if the instance goes down or something else happens you will lose your work. Also before you quit you have to download the notebook as I cannot guarantee that it will still be there if you go offline and back up.
