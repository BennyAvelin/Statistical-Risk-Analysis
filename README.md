# Computer lab in Statistical Risk Analysis

This is the starting point for the Computer Lab in Statistical Risk Analysis. The computer lab will be done in [Python](https://www.python.org) and specifically it will be done in a notebook server called [JyPyteR](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). For simplicity of this lab you are not required to install anything, just click the badge below and a Binder instance will spin up for you
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/BennyAvelin/Statistical-Risk-Analysis/master).

When you click this you will be redirected to a website where you have to wait until the notebook instance has started, it will then reload and you will be facing Jupyter. You will be facing a list of files, specifically
* Python.ipynb
* Pandas.ipynb
* Computer_lab_Poisson_Regression.ipynb

I recommend that before we have our computer session, you test the system by clicking the badge above, and walk trough both Python.ipynb and Pandas.ipynb.

During the run of this instance it will be possible to edit and save the file, but please make sure you download the notebook regularly since if the instance goes down or something else happens you will lose your work. Also before you quit you have to download the notebook as I cannot guarantee that it will still be there if you go offline and back up.
