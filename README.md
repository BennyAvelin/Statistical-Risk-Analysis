# Computer lab in Statistical Risk Analysis

This is the starting point for the Computer Lab in Statistical Risk Analysis. The computer lab will be done in [Python](https://www.python.org) and specifically it will be done in a notebook server called [JyPyteR](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). For simplicity of this lab you are not required to install anything, just click the badge below and a Binder instance will spin up for you
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/BennyAvelin/Statistical-Risk-Analysis/master?filepath=Computer_lab_Poisson_Regression.ipynb).

When you click this you will be redirected to a website where you have to wait until the notebook instance has started, it will then reload and you will be facing a notebook. During the run of this instance it will be possible to edit and save the file, but please make sure you download the notebook before you quit as I cannot guarantee that it will still be there if you go offline and back up.
